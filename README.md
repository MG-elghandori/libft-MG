## libft-MG
The libft library is an individual project of the 42 school that aims to recreate some functions of the standard C library for future projects and to have a deeper understanding of data structures and basic algorithms. It is divided into four sections: libc functions, additional functions, bonus functions, and personal functions. The libc functions are functions from the standard C library, while the additional and bonus functions are useful for future projects. The personal functions are functions that you find useful for your own use. You can view your repository to see the methods you used to create this library.
